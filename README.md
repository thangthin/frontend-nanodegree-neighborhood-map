Neighborhood map is a web application that lists out popular places
recommended by google based upon user input search. 
 --The map is prepopulated with a nearby search of user's input city (default 	city for now is Boston, MA).
 --User can modify places displayed on map by submitting a new search value
   for the place search.
 --User can also update the city by searching for new city.
 --A new city search will also update the list view and markers of places
   based on the last query user submitted.

 Mobile version of site will not automatically display street view, rather user will have to toggle the display with the road button at the top right corner. User can also toggle any necessary features to display on screen as user sees fit. The 'x' button is used to closed out all display. The list button is used to toggle list view.

 The user search experience will also differ based on users' screen size. The list will automatically be closed out after user click on a place object. New search will also automatically display the list view.


The application utilises the Google Map API, Google Places API, and Google Street View API.
