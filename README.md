How will I complete this Project?

Review our course JavaScript Design Patterns.
Download the Knockout framework.
Write code required to add a full-screen map to your page using the Google Maps API.
Write code required to add map markers identifying a number of locations your are interested in within this neighborhood.
Implement the search bar functionality to search and filter your map markers. There should be a filtering function on markers that already show up. Simply providing a search function through a third-party API is not enough.
Implement a list view of the identified locations.
Add additional functionality using third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, StreetView/Flickr images, etc). If you need a refresher on making AJAX requests to third-party servers, check out our Intro to AJAX course.
